# R-003 Failure Modes Resolver Test

**Purpose:**  
This test validates that resolver failures, missing resolvers, and runtime errors are correctly handled and surfaced by the parser/runtime.

**Workflow:**  
- Workflow Name: `TestResolverFailureModes`
- Parameters: `userInput`
- Allowed Resolvers:
  - `ReliableResolver`
  - `UnstableResolver`
- Steps:
  1. `Ask ReliableResolver` → `saveAs: reliableResult`
  2. `Ask UnstableResolver` → `saveAs: unstableResult`
- Return Values: `reliableResult, unstableResult`

**Assertions:**  
1. Steps 1 & 2 are correctly parsed as `ask` resolver steps.  
2. `saveAs` values are normalized.  
3. Return statement lists all resolver outputs.  
4. Errors from failing resolvers (e.g., `UnstableResolver`) are surfaced.  
5. Missing resolvers (e.g., `MissingResolver`) trigger proper errors.
